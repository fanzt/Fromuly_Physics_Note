# How to learn English

*If I need to share some my suggestions.*

## Listening

If you want to improve your English listening skills, it is a useful way to develop a habit of watching English TV plays and listening English songs. Choose some English TV programs that you are interested in, so that you can practice your listening ability through this method without getting bored.

## Speaking

The best way to enhance your English speaking skills is to make friends with a native English speaker, and communicate with him/her frequently, in English. By this way, you can learn the idiomatic way of speaking English, and thus you can improve your English spoken language competence.
